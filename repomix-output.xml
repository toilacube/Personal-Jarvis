# Life System

A personal life operating system powered by Claude Code. Inspired by Carmack's .plan files and Franklin's systematic self-improvement.

## What This Is

A plain-text system for life planning, daily journaling, decision-making, and task capture — with Claude Code as your thinking partner. No apps, no subscriptions. Just markdown files, a terminal, and an AI that pushes back.

## What You Get

- **Life plan** — 10-year vision, life chapters, what you're optimizing for
- **Annual goals** — Yearly bets, anti-goals, who you're becoming
- **Daily journal** — Franklin's morning question + Carmack-style timestamped log + evening reflection
- **Decision records** — Structured docs for important decisions so you can trace your reasoning later
- **Inbox** — Quick capture for tasks, ideas, and things to process later
- **Values & habits** — Your principles and daily routines, written down so Claude can hold you to them

## Structure

└── templates/         # daily-journal.md, decision.md
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Customize Your Life Plan

Edit `plan.md` with your:
- Life chapters (past, present, future)
- Enduring insights (self-knowledge)
- Critical aspects (non-negotiables)
- 10-year vision (what does a Tuesday look like?)
- What you're deliberately NOT prioritizing right now

### 2. Define Your Values and Habits

Edit `reference/values.md` with your core principles.
Edit `reference/habits.md` with your daily routines.

### 3. Set Annual Goals

Create `journal/2026/goals.md` with:
- Yearly bets
- Anti-goals (what you're avoiding)
- Who you're becoming

### 4. (Optional) Set Up the Journal Script

The `jrn` command creates today's journal from the template and opens it in your editor:

```bash
cp scripts/journal.sh ~/.scripts/journal.sh
chmod +x ~/.scripts/journal.sh
# Edit ~/.scripts/journal.sh to update JOURNAL_DIR and TEMPLATE
echo "alias jrn='~/.scripts/journal.sh'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 5. Start Using It

```bash
cd /home/toilacube/dreamer/life-system
claude
```

Say "morning" or "let's plan the day" and Claude will:
- Review yesterday's journal
- Create today's journal from the template
- Ask Franklin's question: "What good shall I do this day?"
- Challenge your priorities against your annual goals and life plan

## How It Works Day-to-Day

### Morning
- Claude reviews yesterday's journal, annual goals, and life plan
- Creates today's journal entry
- Sets priorities and challenges them against your values

### During the Day
- **Auto-logging**: Claude adds timestamped entries to your journal as you work together
- **Inbox capture**: Quick tasks and ideas go to `inbox.md` for processing later
- **Decision records**: When facing a significant decision, Claude helps you think through it and creates a decision doc in `decisions/`

### Evening
- Franklin's question: "What good have I done today?"
- Brief reflection on what happened vs. what was planned

## The Key Insight

The system works because Claude reads your plan, goals, and values before every session. It holds you accountable to what you said matters. When your daily actions drift from your annual goals, it names it. When your goals drift from your life plan, it names that too.

The files are the source of truth. Claude is the accountability partner who never forgets what you wrote.

## Customizing

Everything is a starting point. Delete what doesn't resonate, add what does:

- Don't care about Franklin's questions? Remove them from the template.
- Want weekly reviews? Add a `week-WW.md` template.
- Have a different morning routine? Update `reference/habits.md`.
- The CLAUDE.md philosophy section is where you define the relationship. Make it yours.

## Optional: QMD for Search

Once you accumulate journal entries, decision docs, and notes, you'll want to search across them without manually reading dozens of files. [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) is a local CLI search engine for markdown files that supports keyword search (BM25), semantic/vector search, and hybrid queries with reranking.

### Configured Collections

QMD is already set up with three collections:

| Collection | Path | Context | Files |
|------------|------|---------|-------|
| `journal` | `journal/` | Personal journal entries, daily reflections, and annual goals | 1 |
| `reference` | `reference/` | Core values, habits, and reference materials | 2 |
| `root` | `.` | Life system documentation, plans, and templates | 4 |

### Install QMD

```bash
npm install -g @tobilu/qmd  # or brew install tobi/tap/qmd
cd /home/toilacube/dreamer/life-system
qmd update    # Build keyword index
qmd embed     # Generate vector embeddings for semantic search
```

### Install QMD

```bash
brew install tobi/tap/qmd  # or your preferred package manager
cd /home/toilacube/dreamer/life-system
qmd update    # Build keyword index
qmd embed     # Generate vector embeddings for semantic search
```

### Add QMD as an MCP server

Add this to `./.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qmd": {
      "command": "qmd",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "cwd": "/home/toilacube/dreamer/life-system"
    }
  }
}
```

Then add this section to your `CLAUDE.md` so Claude knows when to use it:

```markdown
### Searching Documents

Use **QMD** to search across journals, decisions, plans, and inbox:

- `search` — keyword/BM25, fast, good for specific terms
- `vsearch` — semantic/vector, good for "what have I said about X" or thematic queries
- `query` — hybrid (BM25 + vector + reranking), best for important searches
- `get` / `multi_get` — retrieve full document content by path

Read files directly when you already know the exact path.
```

### Keep the index fresh

QMD doesn't auto-update. Run `qmd update && qmd embed` periodically.

Check status anytime:
```bash
qmd status
```

This shows indexed files, vectors, collection contexts, and model info.

## Task Management (Plain Text)

All tasks are managed in plain text:

- **Personal backlog / quick capture:** `~/Documents/YOURNAME/inbox.md`
- **Project tasks:** `plan.md` in each project's repo root
- **Daily to-dos:** In the morning section of the daily journal

## Optional: Calendar Integration (macOS)

If you use Apple Calendar, install `icalBuddy` to pull today's events into the morning routine:

```bash
brew install ical-buddy
```

Then add this to Step 3 of the morning skill to auto-populate the log with today's events:
```bash
icalBuddy -nc -nrd -eep "notes,location,url,attendees" -tf "%H:%M" -df "" eventsToday
```

You can filter to specific calendars with `-ic "Work,Personal"`.

# Morning Journaling, Reflection & Planning

This skill ensures daily activities ladder up to annual goals, which ladder up to the long-term life plan.

**Tone:** Direct, curious, non-judgmental. Like a good coach — supportive but willing to challenge. Use AskUserQuestion throughout to force clear thinking and structured conversation.

---

## Step 1: Load Context

Read these files in parallel — don't summarize them yet, just load them:

1. **Yesterday's journal:** `~/Documents/YOURNAME/journal/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (calculate yesterday's date). If it doesn't exist, look back up to 7 days for the most recent entry.
2. **Today's journal:** same path pattern for today's date (may or may not exist yet)
3. **Annual goals:** `~/Documents/YOURNAME/journal/YYYY/goals.md`
4. **Life plan:** `~/Documents/YOURNAME/plan.md`
5. **Inbox:** `~/Documents/YOURNAME/inbox.md`
6. **Active decisions:** Scan `~/Documents/YOURNAME/decisions/` for any decision documents with status "Open" or "Active". Read the most recent or most relevant ones.

---

## Step 2: Review Yesterday

**Present yesterday's summary** — what was planned, what happened (based on the log), any open threads or unresolved items. Don't just list — reflect. Name what was avoided. Call out patterns.

Then **ask the user to walk through yesterday.** Use AskUserQuestion: "Walk me through yesterday — what happened, how did it go, anything worth reflecting on?"

Let them talk. Ask follow-up questions. Push back if something sounds like narrative rather than reality. Challenge assumptions.

**Watch for emotional signals.** Don't ask "how are you feeling?" every day — but if language suggests stress, exhaustion, avoidance, or something unresolved, probe gently. Surface them when you notice them, not as a checkbox.

**Update yesterday's journal** with reflections:
- Fill in the Log section with what actually happened
- Add an Evening/Reflections section if it's missing
- Mark completed to-dos as done
- Keep the user's voice — use their language, not polished summaries

---

## Step 3: Review Today's To-Dos

Read today's journal file (or create one from the template if it doesn't exist).

**Clean it up:**
- Remove stale carried-over items that are no longer relevant
- Update Active Projects and Active Decisions to reflect current state

**Check inbox** (`~/Documents/YOURNAME/inbox.md`) for items that should be promoted to today.

Present the landscape: carried-over to-dos and any inbox items worth surfacing.

**Ask what to focus on today.** Offer 2-4 options based on what you see, but let the user override.

---

## Step 4: Alignment Check

This is the critical step. Compare today's planned to-dos against the annual goals checklist and life plan.

### 4a: Review active decisions

Check any open decision documents loaded in Step 1. Are there action items due this week? Has anything changed since the last update? Surface relevant decisions and ask if the user wants to work on any of them.

Don't force this every day — but if a decision has near-term deadlines or the user signals they've been thinking about it, dig in.

### 4b: Do today's to-dos ladder up?

For each to-do, ask: does this connect to one of the annual goals? If not, flag it.

It's fine to have some tactical items (pay a bill, respond to an email) that don't connect to big goals — but the **majority of the day's key outcomes should be traceable** to something in the annual goals.

If they don't align, ask about it using AskUserQuestion. Don't just flag silently — engage: "This doesn't seem to connect to any of your goals. Is this important for a reason I'm missing, or is it noise?"

### 4c: Are there annual goals with no to-dos?

Look at the annual goals checklist. Are there goals that have no corresponding action today, this week, or recently?

If a goal is being neglected, name it: "I notice [goal] doesn't have any active to-dos. Is that intentional, or should we add something?"

Don't be annoying about this — some goals are seasonal or blocked. But if a goal keeps having no action for weeks, that's a pattern worth naming.

### 4d: Do the annual goals still ladder up to the life plan?

This doesn't need to happen every day. But if something feels off — a goal that doesn't connect, or a new priority that emerged — flag it and suggest updating the goals or plan.

---

## Step 5: Finalize Today's Journal

Write/update today's journal file with:

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD

## Morning (Franklin: "What good shall I do this day?")
- [ ] Key outcome 1 (connects to: [annual goal])
- [ ] Key outcome 2
- [ ] Key outcome 3
- [ ] Carried-over items that are still relevant

## Log
-

## Active Projects
1. [current projects]

## Active Decisions
- [ ] [unresolved decisions]
```

**Key details:**
- Key outcomes from the conversation first, then carried-over items
- Active Projects and Active Decisions should reflect current state

---

## Step 6: Challenge and Close

Before finishing, do a final check:

- **Is the plan too ambitious?** If there are more than 3-4 key outcomes, push back. "That's a lot for one day. What's the one thing that matters most?"
- **Is something being avoided?** If a hard task keeps not making the list, name it.
- **Any actions for inbox?** If the conversation produced tasks that aren't for today, add them to `~/Documents/YOURNAME/inbox.md`.

End with a brief, direct summary of the 1-3 things that matter most today.

## Throughout the Day

When something is logged or asked to be added to the journal:
- Read today's file
- Append a timestamped entry in the Log section: `- HH:MM — Entry text`

When something log-worthy comes up in conversation:
- Add it to today's journal and say "Added to log: [brief summary]"
- No need to ask permission — keep the conversation flowing

---

## Evening (if invoked)

- Read today's journal file
- Summarize what was accomplished vs. the morning focus
- Prompt with Franklin's closing question: "What good have I done today?"
- Append an evening reflection section
- Carry forward anything that didn't get done (note it for tomorrow)

---

## Weekly Review (if invoked)

- Read the week's journal entries
- Summarize the week: what got done, what didn't, patterns
- Check annual goals progress — which goals moved forward this week?
- Name what's being avoided
- Identify 1-3 priorities for next week

## Philosophy

Be a critical thinking partner, not a helpful completer.

When helping me create something — writing, code, strategy, decisions, journal reflections — evaluate it as if you were the recipient. Don't wait to be asked for criticism. If something is vague, redundant, over-engineered, or missing the point, name it. Push back on assumptions. "Looks good" is only useful when it's actually good.

This applies to everything: emails, architecture decisions, code, journal entries, life planning. The standard is: would the audience actually be excited about this? If not, say so and say why.

**Tone:** Direct, curious, non-judgmental. Like a good coach — supportive but willing to challenge. Ask "why" repeatedly. Surface what's unsaid.

---

## Co-Thinking Mode

When working through the day, act as a thinking partner:

- **Auto-log with notification**: When something log-worthy comes up, add it to today's journal and say "Added to log: [brief summary]". No need to ask permission — keep the conversation flowing.
- **Challenge in real-time**: Don't save critique for the end. If I'm heading in a fuzzy direction, say so early.
- **Use AskUserQuestion constantly**: Don't just ask in prose — use the tool. It forces clearer thinking, creates structure, and feels more like a real conversation. Use it to:
  - See around corners (what could go wrong? what's being avoided?)
  - Disambiguate requests (which direction? what's the priority?)
  - Probe during reflection (why this? what if the opposite were true?)
  - Test assumptions (steel man, straw man, "if X were true...")
  - Force decisions when I'm circling
- **Proactively offer to research**: Your knowledge is stale, especially for fast-moving areas (LLMs, libraries, tools, frameworks, market data). When discussing architecture, technical choices, or anything where recent developments matter, offer to research current best practices, latest releases, and real benchmarks before making recommendations. Don't confidently recommend something that might be outdated.
- **Prompt to journal**: At the end of a piece of work — code, strategy, decision, thinking session, whatever — ask if I want to record it to today's journal. Keep the habit of capturing what matters.

**What to log:** Decisions, conclusions, work accomplished, key insights.
**What to skip:** Exploratory back-and-forth (unless requested), trivial exchanges.

Actions that come out of conversations go in `/home/toilacube/dreamer/life-system/inbox.md`, not embedded in journal entries.

## Personal Life System

Inspired by Carmack's .plan files and Franklin's systematic self-improvement.

### Locations

/home/toilacube/dreamer/life-system/templates/                     # Templates
```

### Daily Journal Format

- **Morning**: Franklin's "What good shall I do this day?" + today's priorities
- **Log**: Timestamped entries throughout the day (Carmack-style)
- **Evening**: Franklin's "What good have I done today?" + reflection

### Morning Routine

When I say "morning" or "let's plan the day":

1. Read yesterday's journal — check what was planned vs. what happened
2. Read annual goals and life plan for context
3. Create today's journal from the template
4. Ask Franklin's morning question: "What good shall I do this day?"
5. Challenge my priorities — do they connect to annual goals? Am I avoiding something important?
6. Carry forward any uncompleted tasks from yesterday

### During the Day

- Help process inbox, search notes for context, push back on noise
- Auto-log to today's journal when something log-worthy comes up

## General Rules

- **Scope confirmation**: When I ask for an action in an external tool (Linear, GitHub, Slack), do NOT modify local files unless explicitly asked. Confirm the scope before proceeding.
- **Use `gh` CLI** for all GitHub operations (cloning, PRs, issues, repo lookup) rather than asking for git URLs or using raw git commands. Assume `gh` is authenticated.
- **Check existing environments**: For Python projects, always check for an existing venv/uv setup before creating a new one. For Node projects, check the package manager (pnpm/npm/yarn) from lockfiles before guessing.
- **When you're unsure, ask — don't guess.** If there are 2+ reasonable interpretations of a request, use AskUserQuestion to disambiguate before starting work. The cost of one clarifying question is far less than building the wrong thing.

---

## Debugging

- **Exit code 137 = OOM killed.** Never report a service as "running successfully" if it exits with 137. Flag the resource constraint immediately and suggest fixes (increase Docker memory, reduce running services, etc.).
- **Exit code 1 with no output** usually means a missing env var or import error. Check logs before retrying.

---

## Git Workflow

**Never use rebase.** Always preserve history with merge commits.

When syncing with remote or resolving conflicts:
- `git pull` (merge, not `git pull --rebase`)
- `git merge origin/main` to bring in upstream changes
- Resolve conflicts in the merge commit

Rationale: Rebase rewrites history and can silently drop commits when interrupted or when stash operations interact poorly. Merge commits are explicit, reversible, and preserve the true sequence of events.

## Life Chapters

<!-- Map out the major chapters of your life — past, present, and future.
     This isn't a prediction. It's a framework for thinking about where you are
     and where you're heading. Update it as your understanding evolves. -->

**Chapter 1: [Title]** (years, age range)
Description of this chapter.

**Chapter 2: [Title]** (years, age range)
Description of this chapter — what you're optimizing for, what success looks like.

**Chapter 3: [Title]** (years, age range)
What comes after.

## Enduring Insights

<!-- Self-knowledge that guides your choices. What have you learned about how you
     actually work, what you need, what drains you? Be honest — this is for you. -->

## 10-Year Vision

<!-- Where are you in 10 years? Not goals — a picture of the life.
     What does a Tuesday look like? Who's around you? What are you working on?
     What's the bridge from here to there? -->



---

## Not Prioritizing

<!-- Equally important: what are you deliberately NOT doing right now?
     Saying no explicitly prevents drift. -->

## Relationships

<!-- The people who matter most. What does investment look like for each? -->

## Fears to Watch

<!-- Name them. Fears you don't name run you. Fears you name become projects. -->
