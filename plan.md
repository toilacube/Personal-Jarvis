# Life Plan

## Life Chapters

<!-- Map out the major chapters of your life — past, present, and future.
     This isn't a prediction. It's a framework for thinking about where you are
     and where you're heading. Update it as your understanding evolves. -->

## 10-Year Vision

<!-- Where are you in 10 years? Not goals — a picture of the life.
     What does a Tuesday look like? Who's around you? What are you working on?
     What's the bridge from here to there? -->

## Not Prioritizing

<!-- Equally important: what are you deliberately NOT doing right now?
     Saying no explicitly prevents drift. -->

## Relationships

<!-- The people who matter most. What does investment look like for each? -->

## Fears to Watch

<!-- Name them. Fears you don't name run you. Fears you name become projects. -->
