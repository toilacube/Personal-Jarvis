## Morning (Franklin: "What good shall I do this day?")
- [ ] Learn about terminal options

## Reading / Learning
- Ghostty terminal + SAND keybindings for Claude Code: https://x.com/i/status/2023151176758268349

SAND mnemonic for panel management:
- **S**plit: `Cmd+D` (right), `Cmd+Shift+D` (down)
- **A**cross: `Cmd+T` (new tab), `Cmd+Shift+←/→` (navigate tabs)
- **N**avigate: `Cmd+Alt+Arrows` (move), `Cmd+Shift+E` (equalize), `Cmd+Shift+F` (zoom/restore)
- **D**elete: `Cmd+W` (close)

Usage: Left panel = Claude Code, Right panel = Lazygit, File browser (yazi) for navigation

- Testing Warp CLI instead (switched from Ghostty) — reason: native text editor and Git diff/source control (VS Code-style)
